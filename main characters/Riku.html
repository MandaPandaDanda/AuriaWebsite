    <p> Riku is like his mother, kind and loving to all. Yet he is quick to anger or irritate, only Faith knows where he got it from. His mannerisms can seem catlike, from his cuddly nature to his desire for space. </p>

    <h3> Backstory </h3>
    
    <p> Riku was born much before Faith was married to who she is married to now. Rikeu doesn’t remember who his father was but still remembers Faith and him fighting over his future. When Riku was around 5 years of age he met Aamon during one of the queen of Obscurum’s visits. They both became fast friends with each other. And then when he was 7 his mother divorced his father, freeing the lives of her people and taking control of her kingdom. Before he knew it his mom had gotten engaged to the Moon Goddess’ priestess and was set to get married that same year, when Riku was around 10. Yet that was when tragedy struck, right before Faith was set to walk the aisle monsters that originated from Infunum ruined the peaceful day. Forcing his mother to conceal the kingdom for its protection. That was also the year the Timekeeper decided to send the descendants away to the different realms to protect them. </p>

He was just playing with some toys and accidentally froze one, Faith laughs about it now because he ran to her crying.

By the age of 9, Riku had pretty much mastered most Glacies spells and was constantly sparring with Aamon who obtained his powers a year after Riku. </p>
