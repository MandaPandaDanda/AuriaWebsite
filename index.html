<!-- IDEA: Give kingdom information their own pages. Have the sections in the basics be what is auria, kingdoms, and characters. Kingdoms page should be a hub for the other pages like the characters page. Also fix layout for characters page and make it look nicer. --> 

<!-- Move character pages into their own folder, and do the same for the kingdom pages when you make them. -->

<!-- Find way to indicate that links (and linked images) are. well. links. -->
