    <h2> Kingdom of Musicorum </h2>


    <h3> Country Based Off of </h3>
    <p> Musicorum’s building style is based on France </p>

    
    <h2> Magic </h2>
    
      <h3> Magic Type </h3>
    
      <p> Magic of Song </p>
    
      <h3> Influence On Culture and Daily Life</h3>
    
      <p> Magic in Musicorum is not relied on as much as the other kingdoms, they have the lowest amount of people who are able to do magic out of all the kingdoms. This being said those born with the magic are praised and are normally from high standing families who have been there since the start.  </p>
    

    <h2> Current Rulers </h2>
    
    <p> Queen Selah Harp, Princess Melody Harp </p>
    

    <h2> Culture </h2>
    
      <h3> Art </h3>
    
      <p> The art of Musicorum is mostly shown through the music that they play instead of more art pieces made with true art mediums. The music shows stories of the kingdom's past and the stories of Auria that flow through the kingdom </p>
    
      <h3> Language Quirks </h3>
    
      <p> While there are no distinct languages that exist in Auria since the kingdoms are still developing. People born and raised in Musicourm tend to speak in a more sing song way, they have a slight accent but it not very noticable unless you are trying to hear it. </p>
    
      <h3> Clothing </h3>
    
      <p> Musicorum’s clothing varies depending on which level of the kingdom you are on, the higher up you are the more intricate your clothes are, embroidered with crystals and jewels.
 </p>
    
      <h3> Religion </h3>
    
      <p> The goddess of harmonies, Viola. The people of Musicorum heavily believe in Religion, every year a new priestess is chosen from the family with sky blue hair and deep purple eyes. The year during the story 4 girls were chosen as they all had descended from the previous priestess. Musicorum is also accepting of other religions, elders will claim that there is no space for other religions but even the queen accepts all of her sisters’ faiths and tries to accommodate when she can. People worship during festivals where the melodies of songs written long ago flow through the streets, they are a huge celebration but only happen once a month. </p>

    
    <h2> Economy </h2>
    
      <h3> Money Status </h3>
    
      <p> Musicorum is one of the more richer kingdoms, the crystals that are all over the land can fetch a high price and they are highly valued. </p>
    
      <h3> Trade </h3>
    
      <p> Musicroum exports many diffrent kinds of crystals since they can be found all over the kingdom. These are never harvested from the animals, that was banned by the Queen 3 years ago. While the kingdom imports wood and stone from Terra, the remaining supply that is, and they tend to import some of the glacial water from Glacies for the festival that marks the chnage of winter to spring. </p>
    
      <h3> Cost of Living </h3>
    
      <p> Depending on where you live this could chnage being it higher or lower. In the upper class, the houses near the castle, the price could raise largely which is why only those who had been there since the beginning can afford homes like that. The middle class is like your average middle class. But the "lower" class is much diffrent, while the cost is lower the quality of life does not change as everyone is treated the same. </p>

    
    <h2> Polictical Climate </h2>
    
    <p> Neutral (idk what else to put) </p>
    

    <h2> Climate and Weather </h2>
    
      <h3> Normal Temperatures/Weather Patterns </h3>
    
      <p> Musicorum has a cool climate, it can get really humid when the sun it at it’s highest peak
 </p>
    
      <h3> Record Highs and Lows </h3>
    
      <p> Record high is 101 degrees while the record low was -21 degress, but that was when Glacies "fell" </p>
      
      <h3> How People Deal With the Weather </h3>
      
      <p> The kingdom is known for having many lakes spread around so if the kingdom ever gets too hot the citizens can always go over to one and cool off in the refreshing water. If it gets too cold Queen Selah will normally have those who have the magic sing the Song of Flame to keep the kingdom warm. </p>

    
    <h2> Cuisine </h2>
      
    <p> Many people of Musicorum focus on a vegetarian diet staying away from meat but they do not shame anyone for eating meat and they enjoy other culture’s food as long as there is no meat. </p>

    
    <h2> Wildlife </h2>
    
      <h3> Flora </h3>
    
      <p> The flora entails so many unique flower varieties that were made in Musicorum and now exist all over Auria and have adapted into each region. </p>
    
      <h3> Fauna </h3>
    
      <p> Musicorum has animals that have adapted to their region and continue to show the beauty and elegance of their kingdom. At night animals that glow will come out making it the perfect time for dates or just going out and enjoying nature. Most animals have some sort of crystal or jewel on them since Musicorum is also known as “the kingdom of crystals.”
