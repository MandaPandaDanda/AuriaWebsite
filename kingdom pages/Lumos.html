      <h3> Religion </h3>
    
      <p> Eileen, the goddess of the sun. It is said that the goddess planted a tree right where the kingdom lives now. Now, the tree resides in the castleâ€™s gardens which are open to the public, the citizens are allowed to go to the tree to pray for anything. The ones with royal Light magic keep the tree healthy and allow for it to continue to grow, without the magic it would end up decaying away and being nothing more than a stump among the flora of the garden. It is known as The Tree of Life.
